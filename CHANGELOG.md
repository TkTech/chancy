Changelog
=========

0.25.0
------

üö® This release requires that you run migrations, as it adds a new queue
setting, `eager_polling`. Call `chancy.migrate()` or use the CLI:

```bash
chancy --app <your app> misc migrate
```

‚ú® Improvements

- `Chancy.wait_for_job()` now accepts a list of states to wait for, so you can
  use it to wait for a job to begin running, retried, etc... instead of just
  finished.
- `Reference()` objects are now hashable and have equality.
- `Chancy.wait_for_jobs()` added to wait for multiple jobs to finish.
- `Chancy.get_jobs()` added to fetch multiple jobs by ID in a single query.
- Added the `eager_polling` option to `Queue` to trigger immediate polling
  whenever an executor slot becomes free. This is useful for low-latency
  processing of jobs with low concurrency, but may increase database load (#48)

üêõ Fixes

- Fixed a bug where a job with a unique_key could run multiple times if
  pushed again after the job had started running (#51), reported by @mrsshr.
- Remove an unused plugin hook `on_worker_started`, which is available via
  the `worker.started` event anyway (#47) by @PaulM5406.


0.24.3
------

üêõ Fixes

- Purely a patch version number bump, as the previous release was not
  properly tagged.

0.24.2
------

üêõ Fixes

- Temporarily remove the ABC base class from `Migration` to fix a
  bug with DataDog monkey patching. (#44)

0.24.1
------

üêõ Fixes

- Fix the API plugin being imported by the CLI when the API plugin is not
  installed (#42)


0.24.0
------

üìù Documentation

- Correction to the cron plugin example (Thanks @PaulM5406)

üêõ Fixes

- Fix for `sync_push_many_ex` using index access for columns instead of key
  by @nico-deforge.
- Fixed a deprecated usage of `ConnectionPool()` with an implicit `open=True`.
- Fixed the `queue.pushed` event not waking up a worker waiting for jobs.

‚ú® Improvements

- Exposed the `created_at` field on a QueuedJob record by @PaulM5406.
- Erase the cached psycopg pool connection when the context manager is closed
  to support multiple connects and disconnects.
- Added `Chancy.sync_declare()`, `Chancy.sync_declare_ex()` and
  `Chancy.sync_get_job`.
- Jobs are now naturally fetched oldest to newest due to the nature of the
  UUID7s that are used for the job IDs. Job features like priority may affect
  this ordering.
- Added the `worker.queue.full` event to notify when a queue's polling event
  ran, but was unable to start any jobs due to the executor being full.
- If a queue pulled its maximum number of jobs, it'll immediately re-poll for
  more, as it's unlikely that the queue is now empty.

0.23.0
------

- Support for django-style database settings as the first argument to the
  `Chancy` constructor to ease integration with Django projects.
- Chancy's dashboard and API now require a login by default. If the CLI is
  used to start the dashboard without an API configured, a random temporary
  password will be generated. Authentication backends are pluggable, and Chancy
  comes with an optional DjangoAuthBackend.
- The dashboard's live event stream is temporarily removed due to Websocket
  routes not properly supporting authentication.
- Many documentation tweaks.

0.22.0
------

üö® This release requires that you run migrations, as it converts all JSON
columns to JSONB. Call `chancy.migrate()` or use the CLI:

```bash
chancy --app <your app> misc migrate
```


- Chancy now starts some default plugins with reasonable defaults if they are
  not configured. This includes the `Metrics`, `Leadership`, `Pruner`,
  `Recovery` and `WorkflowPlugin`.
- Queue's now support a `resume_at` option, which allows them to automatically
  go active after the specified time. This can be used to implement circuit
  breakers.
- Added the convenience functions `Chancy.pause_queue()` and
  `Chancy.resume_queue()`. Calling this functions will emit `queue.paused` and
  `queue.resumed` events.
- Plugins *must* now provide a `get_identifier()` method, which should return a
  unique identifier for the plugin.
- Plugins *may* now implement `get_depdenencies()` to return a list of other
  plugins that they depend on.
- The default queue polling interval for new queues has been increased from
  1 to 5 seconds.
- All JSON columns have been converted to JSONB, which is more efficient and
  allows for indexing, and is supported by Django's JSONField type.

**Metrics Plugin**

- Internal implementation of the Metrics plugin has been significantly
  simplified.
- Metrics plugin now tracks job completion status on a per-queue basis as well
  as globally, which allows for the implementation of global, per-queue circuit
  breaker logic.

**Django**

- Chancy now comes with a Django app that gives you ORM and Admin access to
  Chancy's data. To install it, add `chancy.contrib.django` to your
  `INSTALLED_APPS`.
- The ProcessExecutor now has a django shim by default, simplifying setup.


0.21.0
------

- Worker's page on the dashboard now shows worker tags and a badge if the
  worker is the cluster's current leader.
- The `workflow.upserted` event has been split into `workflow.created` and
  `workflow.updated` events. Added a new `workflow.step_completed` event.
- `WorkflowPlugin.push` now only pushes the workflow if it has actually changed.
- `workflow.step_completed` is now used to nearly instantly progress a workflow
   to the next step, instead of waiting for the next polling interval.
- The `WorkflowPlugin` now exposes `_ex` versions of most functions which touch
  the database, allowing you to pass in your own cursor to ensure that a
  workflow is created in the same transaction as other operations.
- The `WorkflowPlugin` now locks the workflow row when updating it and performs
  all updates in a single transaction.
- All `_ex` functions which take a cursor now expect a cursor using a dict_row
  row factory.
- Improved metrics display by adding automatic formatting for large numbers
  (K, M, G) on chart Y-axes.
- Added `get_schedules()` helper method to the Cron plugin to retrieve
  scheduled jobs.
- Added a live stream of the internal events queue to the dashboard.
- Table size metrics are now collected for all tables known to plugins.

0.20.1
------

- Workers that had no metrics to _push_ skipped _pulling_ metrics from other
  workers, which mainly affected a standalone API worker (since it would never
  have metrics)

0.20.0
------
- Built-in support for metrics via the `Metrics()` such as job, queue and worker
  throughput, job completion times, and more. Available via the API and the 
  dashboard.
- Added the ability to filter by job name in the dashboard.
- Added a `--plugin` option to the `chancy misc migrate` command to migrate only
  a specific plugin.
- Fix the `JobRule.Job` preset, which still referenced the old `payload->>func`
  field.

0.19.0
------
- All executors now support a default concurrency, which typically mimics the
  default of the underlying pool.
- The ProcessExecutor, ThreadExecutor, and SubInterpreterExecutor now
  support running async jobs. This works by starting new event loops in the
  child process or thread, and running the job in that event loop.
- A `default` queue backed by a ProcessExecutor is now created whenever a
  worker starts up if it is missing.
- The internal event hub now supports wildcard handlers, useful for tracing and
  debugging.
- Workers now attempt to drain their queues before shutting down, to ensure
  that all jobs are processed. If the timeout is reached, the worker will
  forcefully shut down and raise a `worker.shutdown_timeout` event.
- Queues can be fully reconfigured on the fly - a worker will now stop and
  restart its queues if the configuration changes, including changing the type
  of executor.
- Limited Windows support - suitable for development, but not recommended for
  production use.
