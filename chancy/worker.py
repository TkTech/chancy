class Worker:
    """
    The Worker is responsible for polling queues for new jobs, running any
    configured plugins, and internal management such as heartbeats.

    Starting a worker is simple:

    .. code-block:: python

        async with Chancy(
            "postgresql://localhost/postgres",
        ) as chancy:
            await chancy.migrate()
            async with Worker(chancy) as worker:
                await worker.wait_for_shutdown()

    Worker Tags
    -----------

    Worker tags control which workers run which queues. A tag is a string
    (typically in the format ``key=value``) assigned to a worker. Declare
    a queue with a list of tags, and only workers with matching tags will
    run that queue.

    Every worker automatically gets some tags, like ``hostname``, ``worker_id``,
    ``python``, ``arch``, ``os``, and ``*`` (wildcard). You can also add custom
    tags when creating a worker.

    .. code-block:: python

        async with Worker(chancy, tags={"has=gpu", "has=large-disk"}) as worker:
            await worker.wait_for_shutdown()

    You could then assign a queue to only run on workers with the ``has=gpu`` tag:

    .. code-block:: python

        await chancy.declare(
            Queue(name="default", tags={"has=gpu"}, concurrency=10),
            upsert=True  # Replaces existing settings
        )

    Tags are regexes, allowing for flexible matching:

    .. code-block:: python

        Queue(name="default", tags={r"python=3\\.11\\.[0-9]+"}, concurrency=10)

    Events
    ------

    The worker emits events that can be listened to by plugins. The following
    events are emitted:

    .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Event
          - Kwargs
          - Description
        * - worker.started
          - worker
          - Emitted when the worker is started.
        * - worker.stopped
          - worker
          - Emitted when the worker is stopped.
        * - worker.shutdown_timeout
          - worker
          - Emitted when the worker encounters a timeout while trying to
            shut down.
        * - worker.queue.started
          - queue, executor, worker
          - Emitted when a queue is started.
        * - worker.queue.removed
          - queue, executor, worker
          - Emitted when a queue is removed.
        * - worker.queue.updated
          - queue, executor, worker
          - Emitted when a queue is updated.

    :param chancy: The Chancy application.

                      not provided, a random UUID will be generated.

                                    poll intervals.

                              cluster.
