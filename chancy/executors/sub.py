    To use this executor, simply pass the import path to this class in the
    ``executor`` field of your queue configuration or use the
    :class:`~chancy.app.Chancy.Executor` shortcut:

    compatible with sub-interpreters. If you encounter issues, you may need to
    switch to a different executor.
