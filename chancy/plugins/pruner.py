class Pruner(Plugin):
    """
    A plugin that prunes stale data from the database.

    .. note::

        This plugin is enabled by default, you only need to provide it in the
        list of plugins to customize its arguments or if ``no_default_plugins``
        is set to ``True``.

    .. code-block:: python

        from chancy.plugins.leadership import Leadership
        from chancy.plugins.pruner import Pruner

        async with Chancy(..., plugins=[
            Leadership(),
            Pruner(
                Pruner.Rules.Queue() == "default" & (Pruner.Rules.Age() > 60)
            )
        ]) as chancy:
            ...

    The pruner will never prune jobs that haven't been run yet or are currently
    running. When the pruner runs, it will also call the
    :py:meth:`chancy.plugin.Plugin.cleanup` method on any plugins that
    implement it, allowing them to clean up any data that is no longer
    needed such as completed workflows.

    Rules
    -----

    You can use simple rules, or combine them using the ``|`` and ``&``
    operators to create complex rules.

    For example, to prune jobs that are older than 60 seconds:

    .. code-block:: python

        Pruner(Pruner.Rules.Age() > 60)

    Or to prune jobs that are older than 60 seconds and are in the "default"
    queue:

    .. code-block:: python

        Pruner(Pruner.Rules.Queue() == "default" & (Pruner.Rules.Age() > 60))

    Or to prune jobs that are older than 60 seconds and are in the "default"
    queue, or instantly deleted if the job is `update_cache`:

    .. code-block:: python

        Pruner(
            (Pruner.Rules.Queue() == "default" & (Pruner.Rules.Age() > 60)) |
            Pruner.Rules.Job() == "update_cache"
        )

    By default, the pruner will run every 60 seconds and will remove up to
    10,000 jobs in a single run that have been completed for more than 60
    seconds.

    .. tip::

        By default, only an Age rule will be covered by an index. If you use
        multiple rules, you may need to create additional indexes to improve
        performance on busy queues.

    :param rule: The rule that the pruner will use to match jobs.
    :param maximum_to_prune: The maximum number of jobs to prune in a single
                             run of the pruner.
    :param poll_interval: The interval in seconds between each run of the
                          pruner.
