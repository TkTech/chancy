class Chancy:
    """
    A Chancy application, along with all of its configuration and common
    functionality.

    Chancy is asyncio-first, and all of its methods are async by default:

    .. code-block:: python

        import asyncio
        from chancy import Chancy, Job, Queue

        def my_job():
            print("Hello, world!")

        async def main():
            async with Chancy("postgresql://localhost/chancy") as chancy:
                await chancy.migrate()
                await chancy.declare(Queue("default"))
                await chancy.push(Job.from_func(my_job))

        asyncio.run(main())

    Chancy does also provide a minimal synchronous interface for pushing jobs
    onto the queue for codebases that are not using asyncio:

    .. code-block:: python

        from chancy import Chancy, Job, Queue

        def my_job():
            print("Hello, world!")

        with Chancy("postgresql://localhost/chancy") as chancy:
            chancy.sync_push(Job.from_func(my_job))

    And of course, it's just Postgres under the hood, so you can always just
    insert jobs directly into the database if you're feeling brave.

    :param dsn: The DSN to connect to the database.
    :param plugins: The plugins to use with the application.
    :param prefix: A prefix appended to all table names, which can be used to
        namespace the tables for multiple applications or tenants.
    :param min_connection_pool_size: The minimum number of connections to keep
        in the pool.
    :param max_connection_pool_size: The maximum number of connections to keep
        in the pool.
    :param poll_reconnect_timeout: The number of seconds to wait before
        attempting to reconnect to the database if a connection is lost.
    :param notifications: Enables or disables emitting notifications using
        postgres's NOTIFY/LISTEN feature.
    :param log: The logger to use for all application logging. If not provided,
        a default logger will be set up.
    :param no_default_plugins: If `True`, the default plugins will not be
        enabled. Defaults to `False`.
