## Key Features

- **Robust Jobs** - support for priorities, retries, timeouts, scheduling,
  global rate limits, memory limits, global uniqueness, error
  capture, cancellation, and more
- **Minimal dependencies** - Core functionality requires only psycopg3 - which
  can be installed side-by-side with psycopg2.
- **Minimal infrastructure** - No need to run a separate service like
  RabbitMQ or redis. Every feature is built on top of Postgres. No need
  for separate monitoring services like Flower or schedulers like Celery
  Beat - everything is built-in to the worker.
- **Plugins** - Several plugins including a dashboard, workflows, cron jobs,
  and more.
- **Flexible** - A single worker can handle many queues and mix threads,
  processes, sub-interpreters, and asyncio jobs, allowing powerful workflows
  that use the optimal concurrency model for each job. Queues can be created,
  deleted, modified, and paused at runtime.
- **async-first** - Internals designed from the ground up to be async-first,
  but has minimal sync APIs for easy integration with existing non-async
  codebases.
- **Transactional enqueueing** - Atomically enqueue jobs and the data they
  depend on in a single transaction.
- **Performant** - Used in production environments to process millions of
  jobs per day.
- **Portable** - Supports Linux, OS X, and Windows.
- **100% open & free** - no enterprise tiers or paid features.
